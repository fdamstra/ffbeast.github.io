# Intro to FFBeast!

In developing this project, my goal was to create a device that bridges the gap between the world of simulation and reality,
both in terms of a wide variety of supported effects and the ability to emulate forces as closely as real pilots
experience on their flight sticks.

For those of you who have looked with envy at the force feedback devices available for the sim racing community and
have dreamt about experiencing the same level of immersion, this device will finally open the window to a new world
for flight simmers.

{: .warning }
>**Warning!** Playing flight simulators with **Force Feedback can be addictive!** Once you've experienced even a single
>flight with FFB, you'll find yourself hooked, never wanting to return to using a traditional spring-loaded joystick again!

# Specs

 - 35Nm peak torque. It allows to achieve 8+ kg force on full length stick.
 - Full metal construction for maximum rigidity and durability.
 - Ball bearings an all moving joints.
 - Compatible with PSU from 12V to 24V.
 - Compatible with DCS, MSFS, il-2, Warthunder, Condor2.
 - Other games support is on roadmap.
 - Compatible with Thrustmaster (Native support. No additional controllers needed).
 - Compatible with VKB (**In form of "Path through"**).
 - Compatible with Virpil (**In form of "Path through"**).

{: .important }
> **"Path through"**
> 
> Is the way of connecting grip to the original controller. 
> The cable will be routed from the extender outside of the box. 
> You will need to have original controller standing close to the base and cable connected to it.

# Want one?

There are several options:

## Build it! 
It is possible to [**build device yourself**](docs/en/joystick_DIY.html). Construction does not require use of special tooling and can be done by anyone

## Or buy it!
In case you want to have ready made device I can build FFBeast base for you.   

### Basic version bundle
It is the version for those who want to spend as low as possible to enter FFB world. 
The price of basic version is **899 Euro + Shipping**. 

It includes:
 - FFBeast base in bare metal look(not painted).
 - Single adapter of choice (either Thrustmaster style connector or adapter to VKB extender).
 - USB cable.

{: .important }
>No PSU will be present in this bundle so you could use any PSU 12V-24V possible to deliver 15A and more.   

### Extended bundle
Depending on your needs and **for additional cost**, basic bundle could be extended with different options:
- Painted enclosure (Black).
- Stick extenders.
- Adapter to connect 2 standard laptop PSU in parallel to achieve required Amp rating.
