# Physical connection

Not much to say there. Just plug USB cable, connect power, and play. 
Right after calibration device is ready to be used as the standard DirectX FFB device.

{: .important }
> It is highly recommended after first connection to check strength of effects using **ForceTest** or alternatives. 
> It gives a chance to understand magnitude of forces and be prepared for effects in game. 

{: .warning }
> **IMPORTANT!**
> 
> Keep stick centered and hold it slightly with your hand when activating effect. As with some settings and effects it could start moving quickly! 

# Game setup

As for today, there are only two games with native implementation of DirectX FFB, and allowing to use the device without additional software. **DCS** and **Il-2** series. In order to use the device with other games check [**FFBeast Commander**](joystick_manual_ffbeast_commander.html) manual page. 

## DCS
To start using FFB in DCS first of all you need to enable **Force Feedback** in **MISC** settings.
