## Supported motor types

FFBeast project based on **BLDC (BRUSHLESS) motor**. None of other types is supported. **There is no DC or Step motor support!** 

But virtually any BLDC motor with three phases will work. From hobby grade to industrial. Performance of the final device
will be determined by your characteristics of the motor you choose. The more torque motor able to produce the stronger will be final device.  

## Howerboard/Scooter motor

As for now howerboard/scooter motor is considered the **best alternative** from the point of **price to torque** relation. 
It could cost as cheap as **10 USD** per item on second hand market, while possible to produce up to **15Nm peak torque**. 

It is possible to found them as separate unit or as the part of refurbished howerboard. 
Just search your local second hand market. 
I bet you will find good propositions for it.

### Are them all equal?
Unfortunately - no!

Despite external dimensions of this motors are similar, them could be different inside. The power of the motor is determined by 
width of the stator, diameter of the stator, number of strands in motor winding.

The most powerful items have stator width 30mm and 300mm magnets. It is coupled with 5 strand in motor winding.

Less powerful items could have 25mm, 20mm or even 15mm stator width and less strands in winding wire.

## How to choose good one?
Unfortunately there is now reliable way to know what motor have inside without disassembling it. Motors could have same
pattern on the front but be different inside. Same time motors with totally different form outside could be similar inside. 

The only approximate method to guess motor internals - is .... the motor weight!
<img src="../../assets/images/on_scales.jpg">

Because more powerful motors have more metal inside their weight should be higher
Internals and power guess by weigh:
- 30mm magnets/stator - 2.9 kg
- 25mm magnets/stator - 2.6 kg
