## Intro
There are a lot of options of assembly the base with different approaches to couple all together. 
This page is covering most compact, but probably, not the cheapest one. So if you consider this variant too expensive or too complicated - just visit 
[**FFBeast Discord**](https://discord.gg/Gt6rnvrZKu) for inspiration. 
There you will find multiple technical solution discussed for each step, and probably solutions which will be easier to implement.
