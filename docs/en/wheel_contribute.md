**You can say your "thanks" there by donating on project development.** 
**It will let me know, that my work is important, and motivate me for further development!**


In case of providing **Device ID** each donation will be rewarded with small gift in form of **Serial Key** for **unlocking extended functionality**.
Extended functionality is not critical for building a wheel, it just gives possibility to change some extra non critical settings
and connect additional buttons/axis directly to ODrive.
