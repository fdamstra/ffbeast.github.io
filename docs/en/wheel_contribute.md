**You can say your "thanks" there by buying premium license for DIY FFB Wheel firmware.** 
**It will let me know, that my work is important, and motivate me for further development!**


You will get single license in form of **Serial Key** for provided **Device ID**. The key will **unlock extended functionality**.
Extended functionality is not critical for building a wheel, it just gives possibility to change some extra non critical settings
and connect additional buttons/axis directly to ODrive.
