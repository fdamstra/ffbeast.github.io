# Wheel premium license

You can say your "thanks" there by buying premium license for DIY FFB Wheel firmware.
It will let me know, that my work is important, and motivate me for further development!

You will get single license in form of **Serial Key** for provided **Device ID**. The key will unlock extended functionality:

- Possibility to change some extra non critical settings.
- Possibility to connect additional buttons/axis directly to ODrive.
