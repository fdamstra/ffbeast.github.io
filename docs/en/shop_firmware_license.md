# Wheel premium license

You can say your "thanks" there by buying premium license for DIY FFB Wheel firmware.
It will let me know, that my work is important, and motivate me for further development!

You will get single serial key for provided device ID in order to activate firmware as Wheel with unlocked extended functionality:

- Possibility to change some extra non critical settings.
- Possibility to connect additional buttons/axis directly to ODrive.
