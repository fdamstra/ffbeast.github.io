## Supported controller types

As for now FFBeast firmware is compatible with controllers compatible with ODrive 3.6 including multiple remixes of it: ODESC and XDrive.
All this controllers are based on schematic for [**ODrive project**](https://github.com/odriverobotics/ODriveHardware) with some slight changes and/or improvements. 
Even so them could look completely different them share common component base and schematic.

## NoName ODrive 3.6 clones
I will not be posting direct links there. But I think all of us know the place where such things come from ;) (Hello A...s.com).
If you are limited on budget, ready to take a risk of faulty components just go and buy any clone you can find. 

## Which is the best?

**There is no one single winner there. You could choose whatever board from mentioned below and is easier to obtain for you. Just choose one and buy!**
